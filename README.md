# Sparta Base Archive

What is this? It's a collection of Sparta Bases I've made throughout 2016 to present day.

The only difference is that the uploads here will all be using [PreSonus Studio One 6](https://www.presonus.com/en/studio-one.html?rdl=true) and not various versions of [Image-Line FL Studio](https://www.image-line.com/fl-studio).

My motivation try to port as many of my .FLP projects over to .Song will be questionable.

## Prerequisites

For the most part, you'll need to have [PreSonus Studio One 6](https://www.presonus.com/en/studio-one.html?rdl=true) installed on your computer.

The challenge comes in getting Image-Line synth VSTs in Studio One, especially deprecated ones like "TS404 Bassline Synthesizer" or something non-standalone like 3xOsc.

This is why I am opting out of trying to make use of plugins that you can't use outside of FL Studio, and I would rather not make use of "FL Studio as a VSTi" in Studio One, which already requires you to have FL Studio installed. I'll simply try to find plugins that mimic the behavior and style of the ones we can't naturally have.

For the plugins, however, you're going to need the following:

- reFX Nexus 4.5.13 _or greater_
  - [X] Factory Presets
  - [x] XP Analog
  - [x] XP Bass
  - [x] XP Bigtone Signature
  - [x] XP Bigtone Signature 2
