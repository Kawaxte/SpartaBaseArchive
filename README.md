# Sparta Base Archive

A collection of Sparta Bases I've made throughout 2016 to current day.

Difference is that I will be using [PreSonus Studio One 6](https://www.presonus.com/en/studio-one.html?rdl=true) and not various versions of [Image-Line FL Studio](https://www.image-line.com/fl-studio).

My motivation depends on when some of them will complete the porting process. I'll be updating this repository as I do so.
